#####  TEAM 6: Karen Pearson, Luis Fernando Ruiz, Phillecia Qualls, Dana Woodruff

Project Hypothesis

Covid-19 is the precipitating event that influenced each factor. It's effect is examined in the following plots.

• Total car sales trend was compared to the Consumer Sentiment trendline.

• The team created weighted average indexes of the targeted twenty-one auto groups to compare to overall S&P 500 performance and to one another pre- and post- COVID.  The four indexes' performance differed from one another and from the S&P 500.
